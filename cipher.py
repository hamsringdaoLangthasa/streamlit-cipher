    Cipher Stream is a simple tool for securely encrypting and decrypting sensitive information. 
    It uses a **seed** (or key) to ensure your data remains private and secure.

    ### Features
    - Encrypt any text using a seed phrase.
    - Decrypt previously encrypted text using the same seed phrase.
    - Provides a simple, user-friendly interface for security enthusiasts.

    ### How It Works
    1. Enter a **seed** (encryption key) and a **secret/encrypted data** (the text to encrypt or decrypt).
    2. Click the appropriate button in the **Encrypt** or **Decrypt** tab.
    3. View the encrypted or decrypted result in real-time.

    **How to Use the Cipher Tool**
    - Navigate to the **Encrypt** tab to encrypt text:
        1. Enter a **seed** (e.g., a passphrase or keyword).
        2. Enter the **secret** you want to encrypt.
        3. Click the **Generate Encrypted Value** button.
    - Navigate to the **Decrypt** tab to decrypt text:
        1. Enter the same **seed** you used for encryption.
        2. Enter the **encrypted data** you want to encrypt.
        3. Click the **Generate Decrypted Value** button.
        4. The decrypted text will be displayed.
        
    **Tips for Better Security**
    - Use a strong and unique **seed**.
    - Keep your seed private and do not share it with others.
    - Store your encrypted data securely.

    **Troubleshooting**
    - Ensure you are using the same seed for decryption as was used for encryption.
    - If decryption fails, verify the encrypted text and seed are correct.
